# Smart Cradle Application

Smart Cradle Application is a mobile app developed as our final project for **CPE 0316-2 - Fundamentals of Mixed Signals and Sensors** course. The application interfaces with an **Arduino-based IoT system** through **Bluetooth (HC-05)** to provide intelligent cradle control functionality.

## Operating Modes

### Smart Mode
- **Automated Operation**: System activates the cradle's motor based on sound detection
- **Sensor Integration**: Utilizes integrated sensors for intelligent response
- **Autonomous Control**: Automatically manages cradle movement based on environmental inputs

### Manual Mode
- **Direct Control**: User-controlled motor operation
- **Real-time Response**: Immediate system feedback
- **Override Capability**: Full manual control when needed

## Key Features

- **Dual Mode Operation**
  - Smart Mode with sensor-based automation
  - Manual Mode for direct user control

- **Advanced Connectivity**
  - Bluetooth integration via HC-05 module
  - Reliable communication with Arduino system

- **Sensor Suite**
  - Sound detection capabilities
  - Motion sensing functionality
