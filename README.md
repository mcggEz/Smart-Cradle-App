Smart Cradle Application
The Smart Cradle Application is a mobile app developed for the final project in the Fundamentals of Mixed Signals and Sensors course. The app connects to an Arduino-based IoT system via Bluetooth (HC-05) to control a motor and music playback. It offers two modes:

Modes:
Smart Mode: Activates the cradle's motor based on sound detection from integrated sensors.

Manual Mode: Allows manual control of the motor.

Features:
Smart Mode: Sound sensors detect noise and automatically activate the system.

Manual Mode: Direct manual control for motor.

Bluetooth Connectivity: Communicates with Arduino via HC-05.

Sensor Integration: Integrates motion and temperature sensors to enhance functionality.

Technologies Used:
Arduino: For embedded system and hardware control.

Bluetooth (HC-05): For communication between the app and the Arduino.

Mobile App Development: Built using React Native, NativeWind, and Expo.

Programming Languages: JavaScript (for React Native) and C (for Arduino).
